The Greengraph Package has been created as part of the assessment 
for the [Research Software Engineering with Python](development.rc.ucl.ac.uk/training/engineering) course.

The code can be invoked with the following command line entry point
greengraph --from <start> --to <end> --steps <numberOfSteps> --out graph.png

The outpout of this call will be a graph that shows the proportion of green
pixels in a series of satellite images between two points (start-end).
